# Udacity Predicting-No-Show-Appointments Project
### Learning project to test if its predictable for patients to miss their appointments in a hospital using python, numpy and pandas.

# Hospital_No_Show_Appointments
This data have data collected about some patients who made appointments, where some of them miss it and others show up. My objective is to try to investigate whether its predictable to miss an appointment and what are the main factors affecting these missed appointments...

### Some Info about the Columns in the DataSet
- `ScheduledDay` tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- `Neighborhood` indicates the location of the hospital.
- `Scholarship` indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
**Be careful about the encoding of the last column: it says ‘No’ if the patient showed up to their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.**
