## Dataset

- This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.('duration_sec', 'start_time', 'end_time', 'start_station_id', 'start_station_name', 'start_station_latitude','start_station_longitude', 'end_station_id', 'end_station_name', 'end_station_latitude', 'end_station_longitude', 'bike_id', 'user_type','member_birth_year', 'member_gender', 'bike_share_for_all_trip','duration_min', 'start_date', 'start_month', 'start_day_of_week','start_hour_of_day', 'age') These vairables are 


## Summary of Findings

- Bike Riders mostly use them to go to work or near places and looking at all the graphs above Relevant to the hourly distribution and the week day distribution support that.
- All Genders use Bikes equally 
- Trip count were so much more in the middle 30s than in 20s and I believe thats because of the higher awarness and maturity of older people may be if we planned to rise some awarness for the 20s we can improve their behaviors towards bike usage and therfore minimizing the gap.

## Key Insights for Presentation

- Different usage pattern between the two type of riders (subscriber/customer) are seen from the exploration. Subscribers use the system heavily on work days (Monday-Friday) whereas customers ride more on weekends.
- Many trips concentrated around 7-9am and 4-6pm on work days for subscribers.
